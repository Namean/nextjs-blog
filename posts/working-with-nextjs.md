Let me just say working with Next.js makes development a joy. After slogging through react, Next.js feels like a god send.
Even after working with it for just a short time a couple days. I can tell that I'll be doing a lot more development and making it one of primary goals to learn Next.js thorougly, even though I have to pick up React instead of Vue.


```js
const fs = require('fs');

let data = JSON.Stringify(fs.readFileSync(fileName).toString());
console.log(data);
```
