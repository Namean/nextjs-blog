### React Components
I havent posted in a while, but I've been making some progress with React, I presented myself with a challenge that took me over 3 days to complete but this mroing around 3am I finally
got it!

So it was a side navigation that shows and some content, something I've notoriously avoided for some time, and I got it working in React, amazing!

The code is on my remote linode server, I need to install git and create a repository for it, when I get a moment.



### FreeCodeCamp
I decided to check in on FreeCodeCamp, there's a few new things, I want to pick back up with it, just as another tool to help me get better a web development.

I look through thier [contribution guides](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/index?id=learning-platform) for a sec too. I think itd be good a good exercise in learning how to contribute to open source and work on a real world project to see how all of that stuff works, with pull requests and understanding how to learn a codebase and how to contribute fixes and the like.

Here's the link to [FreeCodeCamp's Github]()

They have over 200 repositories!

Freecodecamp uses something called [MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/#mdx), which is an extension of markdown, and it can be [used with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)!




### Courses

I'm going to take a break from freeform learning, which I think I have the hang of and try and just do courses for the next 3 months
