I skipped a few lessons but Here I'm at the section of

types
[Variable Type Annotations](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/introduction-to-typescript/exercises/variable-type-annotations)

We can tell TypeScript what type something is or will be by using a type annotation

varaibles can have type annotations (also known as type declarations) added just after their names

TypeScript is aware of JavaScript's basic types

number, string, boolean, and has a type called any

```ts
let mustBeAString : string;
mustBeAString = 'Catdog';

mustBeAString = 1337; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
